      "description": "Here's the thing—most people never start because they're waiting for the perfect moment. This challenge breaks that pattern. You're going to ask someone you know to invest just one dollar in your future venture. Yep, seriously. Just a buck. Ask now.",
      "instruction": "Pick someone who believes in you—a friend, family member, or colleague. Tell them you're starting a business and you'd love their support. In exchange for their dollar, promise to keep them updated on your journey. This isn't about the money. It's about taking that first uncomfortable step and getting someone else invested (literally) in your success.\n\nTry something like: \"Hey, I'm starting a business and I'd love your support.

You might be surprised by what they say.\n\nHere's a simple way to ask: \"I'm exploring some business ideas and I value your opinion.

You're training yourself to get comfortable with asking for things, even when it feels awkward. Every entrepreneur needs this skill.",
      "instruction": "Head to any coffee shop, place your order, and when it's time to pay, ask: \"Could I get 10% off today?\" Then—and this is key—shut up. Don't explain, don't laugh nervously, don't fill the silence. Just wait for their response. Notice how it feels. This is your practice run for much bigger asks down the road.",

What's been sitting on your to-do list forever because you keep avoiding it?\n3. What's something you're just... not good at, no matter how hard you try?\n4.

Pay attention to:\n• What are people repeatedly asking for?\n• What items have tons of bids or watchers?\n• What's selling out fast?\n• What do people complain is hard to find?\n\nJot down at least one product or service idea based on what you discover.",

Try phrases like \"how to,\" \"best way to,\" or \"where can I.\" Also check out Reddit communities like r/SomebodyMakeThis where people literally beg for solutions.\n\nPay attention to whether the problem is a \"vitamin\" (nice to have) or a \"painkiller\" (desperately needed).
